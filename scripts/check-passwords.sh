# This script iterates through a list of staged files and checks for the
# presence of the string "password =". It intentionally ignores any files
# within the 'tests/' directory, as mock passwords are required for testing.
#
# If a forbidden string is found in a non-test file, it prints an error
# message and exits with a status code of 1, blocking the commit.
#
# @usage
#   ./scripts/check-passwords.sh file1.py file2.ts ...

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
