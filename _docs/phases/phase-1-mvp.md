# 📈 TRAIDER Phase 1: Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

### Core Trading System Implementation *(Target: 3-4 weeks)*

---

## 📋 Phase Overview

Transform the foundation into a working autonomous trading system. This phase implements the core trading loop: market data ingestion, signal generation, risk management, order execution, and portfolio tracking. The system will be capable of paper trading with basic strategies.

**Goal**: A fully functional autonomous trading system running in paper mode with real market data, generating signals, and executing simulated trades with proper risk controls.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Trading Loop Architecture
```python
# Main trading loop (runs every 15 seconds)
async def trading_loop():
    # 1. Get latest market data
    market_data = await get_latest_prices()
    
    # 2. Calculate features
    features = await calculate_features(market_data)
    
    # 3. Generate signals
    signals = await generate_signals(features)
    
    # 4. Check risk constraints
    risk_approved = await validate_risk(signals)
    
    # 5. Execute approved trades
    if risk_approved:
        await execute_trades(signals)
    
    # 6. Update portfolio
    await update_portfolio()
    
    # 7. Emit real-time updates
    await emit_dashboard_updates()
```

    setPositions(data.positions)
  })
  
  socket.on('trade_executed', (data) => {

    showTradeNotification(data)
