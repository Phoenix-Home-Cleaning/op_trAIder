# 📈 TRAIDER V1 – Institutional-Grade Autonomous Crypto Trading Platform

### Comprehensive Project Overview *(June 28 2025)*

---

## 1 · 🎯 Purpose

TRAIDER exists to build a **fully autonomous, risk-controlled, machine-learning-augmented cryptocurrency trading system** that:

1. **Connects directly to Coinbase Advanced** for real-time market data and order execution.
2. **Generates, validates, and executes trading signals 24 × 7** with zero manual intervention.
3. **Delivers positive risk-adjusted returns** while meeting institutional standards for reliability, observability, and security.
4. **Creates a scalable foundation** for multi-broker, multi-asset expansion (equities, futures, etc.) in future phases.

## 4 · 📡 Guiding Principles

1. **Production-First** – Design for live reliability before adding features.
2. **Risk Over Return** – Capital preservation is priority #1.
3. **Observability Everywhere** – If it isn’t monitored, it doesn’t exist.
4. **Single Source of Truth** – One path from tick → feature → signal → order.
5. **Reproducibility** – Back-test logic must be bit-identical to live code.
6. **Security by Default** – Secrets in Vault, MFA, key-rotation, signed images.
7. **Fail Fast / Fail Safe** – Kill switch & circuit breakers guard against runaway losses.
8. **Modularity** – Each service can be swapped or scaled independently.
9. **Chaos-Ready** – Regularly inject faults to validate resiliency.

## 5 · ✅ Current Strengths

- Clear SMART KPIs aligned with pro desks.
- Explicit risk-first culture & hard kill-switches.
- Service modularity mirrors modern HFT/HF stacks.
- Robust observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OTel).
- Discipline around CI/CD, type-safety, and paper-mode validation.

## 6 · ⚠️ Identified Gaps & Risks

| Theme                | Gap                                   | Impact                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Microstructure**   | L2 depth data not originally captured | Alpha & slip models blind           |
| **Data Consistency** | SQLite sneaking into research path    | Drift between research & prod       |
| **Txn-Cost Model**   | No maker/taker & spread simulation    | Over-optimistic back-tests          |
| **Sizing**           | Fixed max-loss only                   | Volatility regime shifts blow risk  |
| **Latency Tails**    | Only P95 tracked                      | Seconds-long outliers → stale fills |
| **Secrets**          | No key-rotation SOP                   | Single leak = total asset loss      |
| **Governance**       | Auto-deploy models without sign-off   | “Model gone wild” scenarios         |
| **DR**               | Single host, no WAL off-site          | Hardware failure = trading blind    |

> **Final Thought:** A simpler system that *never* loses data, mis-sizes positions, or leaves orphaned orders will beat a feature-rich prototype that blows up on day 17. Tighten the plumbing, add microstructure awareness, and instrument everything—then layer on alpha.
