## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### 1. Shared Test Infrastructure

**File:** `tests/unit/backend/factories.py`

- Created centralized test data factories
- Eliminated code duplication across test suites
- Implemented deterministic test data generation
- Added parametric test scenarios for comprehensive coverage

**Key Features:**

- `make_position()` - Position model factory with realistic defaults
- `make_trade()` - Trade model factory with validation
- `make_signal()` - Signal model factory for future expansion
- Predefined test scenarios for systematic testing

### 2. Parametric Position Tests

**File:** `tests/unit/backend/test_models_position_parametric.py`

- **28 comprehensive test cases** covering all position scenarios
- Property-based testing for P&L calculation invariants
- Complete position lifecycle testing (open → update → close → reverse)
- Edge case validation (zero quantities, None values, boundary conditions)

**Critical Coverage Areas:**

- Position direction properties (long/short/flat)
- Market value updates with real-time P&L calculation
- Trade addition with average cost calculations
- Position closing with realized P&L computation
- Position reversal scenarios (long → short, short → long)

### 3. Parametric Trade Tests

**File:** `tests/unit/backend/test_models_trade_parametric.py`

- **37 comprehensive test cases** covering all trade scenarios
- Notional value calculation validation
- Fee and net amount computation testing
- Trade direction and side validation
- Property-based invariant testing

**Critical Coverage Areas:**

- Trade creation and validation across all scenarios
- Notional calculation consistency (quantity × price)
- Net amount computation (notional - fees)
- Trade direction properties (buy/sell validation)
- Input validation and error handling
