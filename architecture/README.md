## Architecture Principles

### Trading System Design
- **Low Latency**: P95 ≤ 500ms signal-to-order execution
- **High Availability**: 99.9% system uptime
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation during failures
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for increased load

### Security Architecture
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Audit Everything**: Complete audit trail

### Performance Architecture
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing where possible
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled service architecture
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching approach
- **Database Optimization**: Optimized queries and indexing

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Strict type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data

### Backend Architecture
- **FastAPI**: High-performance Python API framework
- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**: Time-series data optimization
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Kafka/Redpanda**: Event streaming

### Infrastructure Architecture
- **Docker**: Containerized deployments
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + OpenTelemetry
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing

## Documentation Standards

All architecture documents should include:
- **Context**: Why this architecture was chosen
- **Constraints**: Technical and business limitations
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered
