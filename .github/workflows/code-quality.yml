# 🔍 TRAIDER V1 - Comprehensive Code Quality & Security Pipeline
#
# Institutional-grade code quality analysis with SonarQube, CodeQL, CodeClimate,
# and comprehensive security scanning for autonomous trading platform.
#
# Performance: <15min total execution with parallel analysis
# Risk: CRITICAL - Code quality gates block production deployments
# Compliance: All quality metrics logged and retained (1 year)
#
# See: docs/infrastructure/code-quality-pipeline.md
# Author: TRAIDER Team
# Since: 1.0.0-alpha
