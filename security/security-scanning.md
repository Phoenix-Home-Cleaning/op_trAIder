# üîí TRAIDER V1 - Security Scanning Documentation

## üéØ Overview

TRAIDER V1 implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security scanning pipeline designed for institutional-grade cryptocurrency trading platforms. Our security-first approach ensures that all code, dependencies, and infrastructure components are continuously monitored for vulnerabilities that could impact financial assets or trading operations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Scanning Components

### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

**Purpose**: Identifies known vulnerabilities in third-party packages and libraries.

**Tools Used**:

- `npm audit` - Node.js dependency vulnerability scanner
- GitHub Security Advisories integration
- Automated Dependabot updates

**Scan Frequency**:

- **Real-time**: On every commit and pull request
- **Daily**: Scheduled scans at 02:00 UTC
- **On-demand**: Manual workflow dispatch

**Failure Criteria**:

- ‚ùå **High severity** vulnerabilities (blocks deployment)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moderate severity** vulnerabilities (warning, manual review)
- ‚úÖ **Low severity** vulnerabilities (informational)

### 2. Secrets Detection

**Purpose**: Prevents accidental exposure of API keys, tokens, and other sensitive credentials.

**Tools Used**:

- **TruffleHog** - Comprehensive secrets scanner
- **Trivy** - Unified vulnerability and secrets detection
- Custom rules for trading-specific secrets

**Detected Secret Types**:

- Exchange API keys (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
- Cryptocurrency private keys and mnemonics
- Database connection strings
- JWT tokens and session keys
- Webhook secrets
- Cloud provider credentials

**Configuration**: `.trivyignore`

### 3. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

**Purpose**: Analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities and coding flaws.

**Tools Used**:

- **GitHub CodeQL** - Semantic code analysis
- **ESLint Security Plugin** - JavaScript/TypeScript security rules
- Custom queries for trading logic validation

**Analysis Coverage**:

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
- Insecure cryptographic practices
- Race conditions in trading logic
- Input validation flaws

### 4. Container Security Scanning

**Purpose**: Scans Docker images and containers for vulnerabilities.

**Tools Used**:

- **Trivy** - Container vulnerability scanner
- Base image security validation
- Dockerfile best practices checking

**Scan Scope**:

- Base image vulnerabilities
- Package vulnerabilities in containers
- Configuration security issues
- Secrets in container layers

### 5. Compliance Validation

**Purpose**: Ensures adherence to institutional security standards and policies.

**Validation Checks**:

- ‚úÖ Security policy presence (`.github/SECURITY.md`)
- ‚úÖ Dependabot configuration
- ‚úÖ Security workflow implementation
- ‚úÖ Audit logging configuration
- ‚úÖ Access control policies

## üö® Security Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

```yaml
# Push to main/develop branches
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

# Pull request events
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# Daily scheduled scans
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # 02:00 UTC daily
```

### Manual Triggers

```yaml
# On-demand security scans
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      scan_type:
        description: 'Type of security scan to run'
        required: true
        default: 'full'
        type: choice
        options:
          - full
          - dependencies
          - secrets
          - sast
          - compliance
```

## üìä Security Reporting

### GitHub Security Tab

All security findings are automatically reported to GitHub's Security tab:

- **Dependabot Alerts**: Dependency vulnerabilities
- **Code Scanning Alerts**: SAST findings
- **Secret Scanning Alerts**: Detected secrets

### Workflow Summaries

Each security scan generates detailed summaries:

```markdown
## üîç Dependency Vulnerability Report

| Severity | Count |
| -------- | ----- |
| High     | 0     |
| Moderate | 2     |
| Low      | 5     |

## üîí Security Compliance Report

| Check             | Status     |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Security Policy   | ‚úÖ Present |
| Dependabot Config | ‚úÖ Present |
| Security Workflow | ‚úÖ Present |
```

### Artifact Retention

Security scan results are retained for compliance:

- **Audit Results**: 90 days
- **SARIF Files**: 1 year
- **Compliance Reports**: 1 year

## üîß Configuration Files

### `.github/dependabot.yml`

Automated dependency updates with security focus:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: 'npm'
    directory: '/'
    schedule:
      interval: 'daily'
    open-pull-requests-limit: 20
    groups:
      security-updates:
        patterns: ['*']
        update-types: ['patch', 'minor', 'major']
```

### `.trivyignore`

Secrets detection configuration:

```toml
[[rules]]
id = "exchange-api-key"
description = "Exchange API Key"
regex = '''(?i)(binance|coinbase|kraken)[-_]?api[-_]?key'''
tags = ["trading", "api", "exchange"]
```

### `.github/workflows/security.yml`

Main security scanning pipeline (300+ lines of comprehensive scanning)

## üö® Incident Response

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Deployment pipeline blocked
   - Security team notified
   - Incident ticket created

2. **Resolution Process**:
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Patch development/testing
   - Security review and approval
   - Deployment with monitoring

3. **Post-Incident**:
   - Root cause analysis
   - Process improvements
   - Documentation updates

### Secret Exposure

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Rotate exposed credentials
   - Revoke API keys/tokens
   - Audit access logs

2. **Investigation**:
   - Determine exposure scope
   - Check for unauthorized access
   - Assess financial impact

3. **Prevention**:
   - Update secret detection rules
   - Developer training
   - Process improvements

## üìà Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators

- **Scan Coverage**: 100% of commits scanned
- **Mean Time to Detection**: <5 minutes
- **Mean Time to Resolution**: <24 hours (high severity)
- **False Positive Rate**: <5%

### Alerting Thresholds

- **Critical**: High severity vulnerabilities in production
- **Warning**: Moderate vulnerabilities accumulating
