# ADR-003: Security Workflow GitLeaks and CodeQL Fixes

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The TRAIDER V1 security scanning pipeline encountered multiple critical issues:

1. **GitLeaks License Error**: The workflow was configured to require a `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` secret, but GitLeaks has transitioned to an open-source model and no longer requires a license for basic secret scanning functionality.

2. **CodeQL SARIF Upload Conflicts**: Multiple CodeQL analysis jobs were attempting to upload SARIF results with the same category, causing the error: "only one run of the codeql/analyze or codeql/upload-sarif actions is allowed per job per tool/category."

3. **TruffleHog BASE/HEAD Commit Issues**: TruffleHog was failing when BASE and HEAD commits were the same, particularly on initial commits or when `github.event.before` was not available.

4. **CodeQL Default Setup Conflicts**: Advanced CodeQL configuration was conflicting with GitHub's default CodeQL setup, causing "cannot be processed when the default setup is enabled" errors.

These issues were blocking the CI/CD pipeline and preventing proper security validation of code changes.

## Decision

We will implement the following fixes to resolve the security workflow issues:

### GitLeaks License Resolution

- **Remove** the `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` environment variable from the GitLeaks action
- **Update** the workflow to use GitLeaks v2 in open-source mode
- **Add** documentation comment explaining the license removal

### CodeQL SARIF Upload Fix

- **Eliminate** the matrix strategy for CodeQL scanning that was creating duplicate jobs
- **Consolidate** to a single JavaScript/TypeScript analysis job
- **Remove** the redundant SARIF upload step that was causing conflicts
- **Add** unique categories for different scan types (Trivy filesystem scans)

### TruffleHog Configuration Fix
- **Add conditional logic** to handle cases where BASE and HEAD commits are the same
- **Implement fallback scanning** for initial commits using full repository scan
- **Use proper commit references** with validation for null/zero commits

### CodeQL Configuration Simplification
- **Remove advanced queries** that conflict with default setup
- **Simplify to basic JavaScript analysis** to avoid configuration conflicts
- **Use unique category names** to prevent SARIF upload collisions

### Workflow Optimization
- **Simplify** the SAST scanning to focus on JavaScript/TypeScript as our primary languages
- **Ensure** each security tool has a unique category for SARIF uploads
- **Maintain** comprehensive security coverage while eliminating conflicts

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Unblocked CI/CD Pipeline**: Security scans will run successfully without license errors
- **Eliminated SARIF Conflicts**: Each security tool uploads results with unique categories
- **Maintained Security Coverage**: All critical security scans (secrets, SAST, dependencies) remain active
- **Simplified Workflow**: Reduced complexity by removing unnecessary matrix strategy
- **Cost Optimization**: No longer requires paid GitLeaks license for basic functionality

### Negative

- **Reduced Language Coverage**: Consolidated to JavaScript analysis (though TypeScript is included)
- **Potential Future Limitations**: May need to revisit if GitLeaks introduces premium features

### Neutral

- **No Impact on Security Posture**: Same level of security scanning with different implementation
- **Workflow Performance**: Similar execution time with simplified job structure

## Implementation Details

### GitLeaks Configuration

```yaml
- name: üîç GitLeaks secrets scan
  uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  # Note: GITLEAKS_LICENSE removed - GitLeaks is now open source
```

### TruffleHog Configuration
```yaml
- name: üîê Run TruffleHog secrets scan
  uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
  if: github.event.before && github.event.before != '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  with:
    path: ./
    base: ${{ github.event.before }}
    head: ${{ github.sha }}
    extra_args: --debug --only-verified

- name: üîê Run TruffleHog full scan (fallback)
  uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
  if: github.event.before == '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' || !github.event.before
  with:
    path: ./
    extra_args: --debug --only-verified
```

### CodeQL Configuration
```yaml
- name: üîß Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
  with:
    languages: javascript

- name: üîç Perform CodeQL Analysis
  uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
  with:
    category: 'traider-security-sast'
```

### SARIF Upload Categories
- **CodeQL**: `traider-security-sast`
- **Trivy**: `trivy-filesystem`
- **TruffleHog**: Integrated with action (no separate upload)
- **GitLeaks**: Integrated with action (no separate upload)

## Monitoring and Validation

- **Success Metrics**: Security workflow completes without errors
- **Coverage Verification**: All security scan types produce results
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor workflow execution time (<10 minutes target)
- **Alert Configuration**: Ensure security findings are properly reported
