# ADR-004: Disaster Recovery and Backup Strategy

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-06-29  
**Deciders**: Infrastructure Team, Security Team, Compliance Team  
**Technical Story**: Infrastructure Resilience Planning - Phase 0 Completion

---

## Context

TRAIDER V1 requires institutional-grade disaster recovery and backup capabilities to ensure business continuity, regulatory compliance, and zero tolerance for trading data loss. As an autonomous trading platform handling real capital, system failures could result in significant financial losses and regulatory violations.

### Background
- **Current Situation**: Basic local backups with manual procedures
- **Problem Statement**: Insufficient recovery capabilities for institutional trading
- **Constraints**: ≤5 minute RTO, zero data loss RPO, 90-day retention minimum
- **Stakeholders**: Trading team, risk management, compliance, infrastructure

### Technical Context
- **Current Architecture**: Single PostgreSQL instance with TimescaleDB
- **Performance Requirements**: 99.99% uptime, sub-second recovery detection
- **Security Implications**: Encrypted backups, immutable audit trails
- **Operational Impact**: 24/7 automated monitoring and validation

---

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy with automated backup systems, continuous replication, and validated recovery procedures to meet institutional-grade requirements.

### Chosen Solution

**Multi-Layered Backup Architecture**:

1. **Database Layer**
   - Continuous WAL streaming to S3 with WAL-E
   - Daily full backups using pg_basebackup
   - Real-time logical replication to hot standby
   - TimescaleDB compression for long-term storage

2. **Application Layer**
   - Redis AOF + RDB snapshots every 5 minutes
   - Configuration backups with encrypted storage
   - Docker image replication across registries
   - Source code mirroring beyond GitHub

3. **Monitoring Layer**
   - Grafana dashboard exports and alerting rules
   - Prometheus TSDB continuous backup
   - Audit log immutable storage

4. **Automation & Validation**
   - PowerShell orchestration scripts
   - Automated restore testing daily
   - Performance monitoring and alerting
   - Quarterly disaster recovery drills

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Option A: Cloud-Native Backup Services Only**
   - **Pros**: Managed service, reduced operational overhead
   - **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited customization, higher latency
   - **Rejected**: Insufficient control for trading requirements

2. **Option B: Synchronous Replication Only**
   - **Pros**: Zero data loss, immediate failover
   - **Cons**: Performance impact, single point of failure
   - **Rejected**: Trading latency requirements conflict

3. **Option C: Manual Backup Procedures**
   - **Pros**: Simple implementation, full control
   - **Cons**: Human error risk, slow recovery, compliance issues
   - **Rejected**: Institutional requirements demand automation

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Business Continuity**: 99.99% uptime with ≤5 minute recovery
- **Regulatory Compliance**: SOX, Basel III, MiFID II audit requirements met
- **Risk Mitigation**: Zero tolerance for trading data loss achieved
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated procedures reduce human error
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent storage tiering reduces backup costs by 60%
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on trading operations (<1ms latency)

### Negative Consequences

- **Infrastructure Complexity**: Multiple backup systems increase operational overhead
- **Storage Costs**: 90-day retention with multiple copies increases S3 costs
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Additional metrics and alerting systems required
- **Testing Burden**: Monthly DR drills require dedicated resources
- **Skills Requirements**: Team needs expertise in backup technologies

### Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk 1: Backup Corruption**
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple validation layers, checksums, test restores
- **Risk 2: Cloud Provider Outage**
  - **Mitigation**: Multi-region storage, local NAS backup copies
- **Risk 3: Automation Failure**
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple alerting channels, manual override procedures
- **Risk 4: Compliance Violations**
  - **Mitigation**: Immutable audit logs, regular compliance reviews

## Implementation

### Action Items

- [x] **Design backup architecture** - Infrastructure Team (Week 1)
- [x] **Implement PostgreSQL backup automation** - Database Team (Week 1-2)
- [x] **Create PowerShell orchestration scripts** - DevOps Team (Week 2)
- [x] **Set up monitoring and alerting** - SRE Team (Week 2)
- [ ] **Implement Redis backup automation** - Infrastructure Team (Week 3)
- [ ] **Create restore validation framework** - QA Team (Week 3)
- [ ] **Document emergency procedures** - Technical Writing (Week 3)
- [ ] **Conduct first DR drill** - All Teams (Week 4)

### Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Core database backup implementation
- **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): Application layer backups and validation
- **Phase 3** (Week 5): Full disaster recovery testing and documentation

### Success Criteria

- **RTO Achievement**: System recovery in ≤5 minutes validated
- **RPO Achievement**: Zero data loss confirmed through testing
- **Automation Coverage**: 95% of backup operations automated
- **Validation Success**: 100% of daily backup validations passing
- **Compliance Readiness**: Audit trail meets all regulatory requirements

## Monitoring and Review

### Metrics to Track

- **Backup Success Rate**: Target 99.9% success rate
- **Recovery Time**: P95 ≤ 5 minutes, P99 ≤ 10 minutes
- **Storage Efficiency**: Compression ratio ≥ 60%
- **Validation Coverage**: 100% of backups validated within 24 hours
- **Cost Optimization**: Storage costs within budget targets

### Review Schedule
